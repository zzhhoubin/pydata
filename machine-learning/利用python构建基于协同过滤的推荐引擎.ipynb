    "\n",
    "协同过滤（Collaborative Filtering）推荐算法是诞生最早，并且较为著名的推荐算法，主要的功能是预测和推荐。算法通过对用户历史行为数据的挖掘发现用户的偏好，基于不同的偏好对用户进行群组划分并推荐品味相似的商品。协同过滤推荐算法分为两类，分别是基于用户的协同过滤算法(user-based collaboratIve filtering)，和基于物品的协同过滤算法(item-based collaborative filtering)。简单的说就是：人以类聚，物以群分。下面我们将分别说明这两类推荐算法的原理和实现方法。\n",

    "### 1.1基于用户的协同过滤算法(user-based collaboratIve filtering)\n",
    "\n",
    "基于用户的协同过滤算法是通过用户的历史行为数据发现用户对商品或内容的喜欢(如商品购买，收藏，内容评论或分享)，并对这些喜好进行度量和打分。根据不同用户对相同商品或内容的态度和偏好程度计算用户之间的关系。在有相同喜好的用户间进行商品推荐。简单的说就是如果A,B两个用户都购买了x,y,z三本图书，并且给出了5星的好评。那么A和B就属于同一类用户。可以将A看过的图书w也推荐给用户B。\n",
