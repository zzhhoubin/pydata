    "Decision trees as a classifier search for a series of rules that intelligently organize the given dataset. As a thought experiment, say you wanted to figure out what country a person is living in. First, you ask if they are in the east or west hemisphere. The answer is west. Are they within the continent of North America? Yes. Are they above or below the 42nd parallel? Above. At this point, you are fairly convinced the person is in Canada. You're not sure. It may be someone from the USA, but most of the people in the world that fit that criteria live in Canada.\n",

    "Each question eliminates some of the ambiguity around what country a person is from. The better the question, the more ambiguity is removed. In this way, the decision tree automates the selection of sequences of questions to form good guesses about the class a sample is in. To demonstrate this, we'll use a common dataset and explore further what the decision tree is doing.\n",

That is, each sample is labeled as one of three specific species of iris along with that sample's sepal and petal length and widths.\n",

Intuitively, you'll see that the red 'blob' of dots is distinct from the other two species. The green and blue 'blob's have some overlap, but are also mostly distinct. Assuming all the flowers in this study were unbiased in growing conditions, sunlight, time to grow, and the like, this 'petal length vs petal width' graph makes a pretty clear point: The proportion of petal with and height stays roughly the same for all three species of iris, though the petal size differs greatly and consistently across all three species. Similar deductions can be drawn from most of the other graphs."
